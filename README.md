## 📝 Competition Overview 
The American Statistical Association DataFest™ is a friendly festival of data in which teams of two to five students work to attack a large, rich and complex dataset over three days. In 2024, the dataset from CourseKata was chosen to analyse.
## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset, an analytical cornerstone of this competition, presents essential information on how students engage with the course provided by CourseKata, including the amount of times students attempted on the quiz, how much time they spent on each chapter, number of "try again" clicks to redo the quiz, and so on.
## 🎯 Objective
The key goal was to analyse the dataset to define which chapter do students struggle the most in CouseKata textbook in order to provide recommendations to help students improve.
## 📌 Key Tasks
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualised and analysed distribution, patterns within the dataset.
* **Experiencing CourseKata course**: Experienced CourseKata to understand how CourseKata works on providing contents and giving feedback.
* **Providing Insights**: Define which chapter is the hardest one based on students' results, identify reasons, then provide recommendation.
## 🔑 Conclusion:
